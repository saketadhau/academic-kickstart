I am a Ph.D. candidate (Stipendiat) at the Norwegian University of  Science and Technology, (NTNU). I am working on the project "Intelligent use of data for process optimization using machine learning" which is financed by the Norwegian research council through the IKTPLUSS program.  I am working under the supervision of Sigurd Skogestad. 
I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from College of Engineering, Pune. My research interests include machine learning, optimization, model predictive control, embedded systems, and process control.
I am strong at solving complex problems and computer programming. I have got advanced skills in C, C++, Matlab and Simulink and I am competent with modelling and simulations of linear and nonlinear models.
