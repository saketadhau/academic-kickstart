I am a Controls engineer with a high interest and focus on embedded devices and predictive control systems.
I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from College of Engineering, Pune. My thesis was Learning Based Model Predicitve Control. I am associated with the  <a href="http://www.coepembeddedlab.com/">Embedded Systems Lab</a> working under the guidance of <a href="http://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sKwGRiYAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. D. N. Sonawane.</a> 
My main interests can be summarized as embedded devices and control systems, Model Predicitve Control. I am strong at solving complex problems and computer programming. I have got advanced skills in C, C++, Matlab and Simulink and I am competent with modelling and simulations of linear and nonlinear models.
